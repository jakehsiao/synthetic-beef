# Guide for React Learners
By Hanchi Xiao (@jakehsiao).

[React]() is a modern and elegant way of developing web pages. **If you want to make a website, you should dive into this right now.**

I recently made a hackathon project using React, and here's the [learning log and stories behind that]().

## Why You Should Learn React
- **The state-of-art and the most elegant way to develop web applications.** It's simply much better than old methods like vanilla javascript or jQuery.
- **Easy to learn.** It only requires the basic understanding of a programming language. Then you can simple create a new react app, and dive into the development.
- **Plenty of community developed components ready to use.** You never need to write everything from scratch. Just grab some components developed by skilled developers, put them together, and you got a super fancy professional-looking webpage!
- **Revolutionary design concepts.** If you do not w

## Prerequisites
To dive into React, you need to know:
- **A programming language.** JavaScript is preferred because React is based on it, or languages with similar syntax like C++, Java or C#. You need to know how to use conditions(if statement), loops(for statement), define functions and classes. To learn more, check [codecademy]().
- **A basic understanding of HTML.** What HTMl pages look like behind the scene, and have a good understanding of "div" and "img" tags, which are used the most. To learn more, check [codecademy]().
- **A basic understanding of CSS.** How to use CSS to styling HTML pages, simple CSS attributes like width, height, margin, border. Understanding of flexbox pattern is better. To learn more, check [codecademy]().
- Some **basic functional programming patterns** like function as parameter, map and reduce. It is not mandatory and you will learn it gradually in the learning process. But React itself is based on functional programming so knowing some helps you a lot.

## Dive into React
- The first class of your React learning journey should always be this great [Codecademy Course](). In my view it is the best React learning tutorial so far.
- Once you know the basic of React, [Create a new React App](), and write something for fun! There are some [learning project suggestions]().
- Also, the modern way to use React is to use [Hooks]() rather than class components. Try change all your class components to functional ones using hooks, and see the difference! Even there are plenty of hooks to use, knowing useState and useEffect is enough for most of the time.

## Rubric of Understanding
- Able to write a simple web application using Create-React-App. Know how to write reusable components using JSX with Hooks, and arrange them layer by layer.
- Know how to use CSS to style your webpage. Know how to use flexbox to arrange the components smartly.
- Know how to fetch API and display the fetched contents.
- Let all your code follow the [style guide]().
- Know some best practices of React, like stateful-stateless architechture, and single-source-of-truth state management.
- Know how to use components that are open source and developed by communities. One of the React's biggest strength is the reusability of components!

## Advanced Learning
If you have already learned everything above and want to move one step further in the journey of React, here are some advanced topics:
