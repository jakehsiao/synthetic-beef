## Prepare for development
- Fork this repository to your own github account by clicking "fork".
- Use your fork as the basis for cloning the repo to your local machine: 
`$ git clone URL_TO_YOUR_FORK`
- Enter your local clone, add the official repo to "uptream" by: 
`$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/jakehsiao/synthetic-beef`
- Create a new branch to work on. You want your master branch to reflect only production-ready code, so create a feature branch for making your changes: 
`$ git checkout -b your-feature`

## Contribute your changes
- First, commit and push:
`$ git commit -a -m "Some changes."`
`$ git push origin your-feature`
- Then, make a pull request on github.
